## 🎓 Study Strategy

### **For Person C (Foundation):**
1. Start with authentication flow - it's the foundation of everything
2. Master JWT concepts - you'll use this knowledge throughout
3. Practice the presentation script - confidence is key
4. Understand the "why" behind each decision

### **For Person B (Intermediate):**
1. Focus on RESTful principles - demonstrate API design knowledge
2. Understand pre-save middleware - this is your unique feature
3. Practice explaining the toggle flow - it's complex but impressive
4. Know how your slice connects to others (creates logs for Member 3)

### **For Person A (Advanced):**
1. Master aggregation pipeline stages - $match, $group, $sort
2. Understand performance implications - be ready for scaling questions
3. Know time-series data design - explain why day/week are strings
4. Be ready for advanced questions about optimization

## 🤝 Team Coordination

### **Presentation Order Suggestion:**
1. **Person C** presents first (Foundation - sets the stage)
   - Shows authentication → Everyone needs this to work
   
2. **Person B** presents second (Intermediate - builds on foundation)
   - Shows device operations → Uses authentication from Person C
   
3. **Person A** presents last (Advanced - showcases expertise)
   - Shows analytics → Uses data created by Person B's device operations

### **Handoff Phrases:**

**Person C → Person B:**
> "Now, [Ashish] will demonstrate how device operations integrate with the authentication system I just showed you. When a user is authenticated, they can manage their devices..."

**Person B → Person A:**
> "When devices are toggled ON, [Hadi] will show how this automatically triggers real-time analytics updates through MongoDB aggregation..."

**Person A → Wrap-up:**
> "The analytics data you see is user-specific, which connects back to Jasikka's authentication architecture, ensuring data privacy and security..."
